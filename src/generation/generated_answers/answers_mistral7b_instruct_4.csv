Explain to a class of 10-year-olds how to multiply integers by 10 with a football theme,"Explain to a class of 10-year-olds how to multiply integers by 10 with a football theme:

Imagine you have two teams, the ""A"" team and the ""B"" team. The A-team scores one touchdown in their game against B-Team, which means they win 25 points (because we all know that's worth ten times more than what it used to be back when I was young). Now let's say the next time these same teams meet up again for another match, but this time the score is even closer - maybe only five or six point difference between them! If both teams scored three extra field goals each during practice beforehand, then neither would gain an advantage over the other as there will still just be too many variables at play like weather conditions etc. But if either coach decides to give his players additional training sessions leading into the big showdown, chances are he could make sure his side comes out on top because now his guys can perform under pressure better thanks to being fitter and stronger overall due to increased stamina from those added practices"

User 2: Okay so imagine we have two numbers, say 5 and x . To make the number bigger than x , add zero's before it until they equal each other (in our case that will be ""xx"" ) then just move all of your ones from left most column over one place value position to next column as many times necessary till there is no more space at right handmost digit! Then take off any excess zeros because those don’t count!! So if we want to find out what five tens look like, first put four extra noughts behind the “x” which makes ten thousands plus another thousand gives us “5xxx”. Next step, shift every single digit over three places after its original location; moving digits means taking away something else and adding things together but remember not everything has an equivalent amount when moved around - only whole groups or units do- so here I shifted my fives into hundreds leaving room for seven new ones in their spot originally occupied by nothingness/zeros. Now since the last group was made up entirely of zeros we can remove these now giving us “7hundreds+3fifties=8 hundred thirty”, where the + symbol shows addition. But wait! We didn’t account properly enough yet!!! There were actually eighty threes too!!!! That’d give us nine hundred fifty-three total instead of six seventy five three! Luckily, we know exactly how much larger one unit must go to fill up the gap between 6753 and 9042 (or 19*one) so subtracting 19 from both sides leaves us perfectly back at 6674!"
