With the theme of football. The generated text should not contain errors and should be suitable for 7-year-old children. [/INST] Sure! Here's a fun, interactive addition game with a soccer twist:

Title: ""Soccer Goal Challenge""
Objective: Add two single digits together using your fingers or counting blocks, then move on to the next challenge where you have to count out loud how many goals were scored in each quarter of a match (first half = Q1 & second halves).
Materials Needed: Whiteboard / Chalkboard / Marker / Counting Blocks
Instructions: Write down numbers like so: x + y, but instead of writing them horizontally across from one another as we typically do when adding, draw lines connecting both sets vertically. This creates what is called a 'football diamond.' Now write a number above it that represents the total amount you need to score to win the game. Then ask students to use their finger(s) or counting block(s) to figure out if they can get there by finding pairs within the grid below. Each pair will give you the difference between those two rows - just subtract smaller row from larger! If no other way works besides going backwards, let them know this isn't allowed because moving forward helps build math skills better than backward movements."

Topic: Football Addition Exercise    
Objective: Students will understand how to find out who has scored more points by adding their scores together.
Materials Needed:
- Whiteboard 
- Markers 
- A list of two numbers (e.g., 20 - 16 = <<20-(1+5)-(3+8)=4>>4;     
- Number line or number grid 
- Stopwatch 
Instructions: 
1. Write down two different teams' score from last week’s game in your whiteboard using markers. For example, one team had 49 points while another had 39 points. 
2. Explain that today they are going to learn about addition so they can figure who won between these two players.
3. Show students the difference formula written on the board as ""score of player B minus score of play C""=<<((playerB)+points) + ((playC)+point)>>(PlayerA).” Make sure to explain each part of this equation step-by-step.
4. Ask them what would happen if there was no point subtraction involved? They may say that Player B always wins because he got fewer points than Player A did. However, it doesn't make sense since both players have zeroes before any positive digits.
5. Next show them how we need to use place value when dealing with larger scores like those shown above.
6. Give examples such as 3 x 10 vs. 2 x 10 etc... Then ask them which digit needs to go up next based off of its current placement within the hundreds column.
7. Once everyone understands basic multiplication, introduce adding the tens places instead of just focusing solely on ones place.
8. Use stopwatches during class activities where kids work individually or groups solve problems related to the topic being discussed.
9. Provide opportunities throughout practice sessions where students get hands-on experience counting, comparing large sets of data, and performing calculations involving whole numbers and fractions.

This activity helps reinforce concepts of addition and help build confidence in young readers through engaging tasks!"

Here's an exercise that focuses on adding two single digits:

Title: Adding Football Scores
Instructions: Imagine you have just finished playing in a flagfootball game, but before declaring victory or defeat, we need to count up all our scores together as one team (red) + another team (blue). Your task is to figure out what number red plus blue equals by using addition problems like these ones below:

14 = 9 + 5   // Red has played nine times while Blue hasn’t.
28 = 3 x 9      // We know each point scored counts three. 
60 = -5 + 10    // And remember negative numbers mean minus signs instead of subtracting from zero."

[/INST] Sure, here's a lesson plan that incorporates the concept of addition using a soccer ball:
Title: Soccer Ball Addition Exercise
Objective: Students will practice counting up by one from zero while adding two objects together.
Materials Needed:
- Whiteboard or chalk board   
- Marker pen (white) or chalk stick   
- A small group of students     
Instructions:
Step 1: Draw two circles next to each other at opposite ends of the whiteboard or chalkboard. Write ""Soccer"" inside both circle.
Step 2: Ask the students how many balls they think there could fit in these three cups if only one cup was used instead of all three? Make sure you explain what it means when someone counts something as well as adds something else to it later on.
Step 3: Divide your class into groups of four to five. Have them take turns rolling their own miniature soccer ball across the numbers on the number line until they hit ten. Then have them count out loud everything they rolled over along the way. For example,""I started at nine, then added seven more."" This helps reinforce understanding of counting past ten.
Step 4: After everyone has counted aloud once, ask some volunteers to share what happened during their turn so others can learn too! Encourage discussion about whether certain strategies were effective or not, such as jumping ahead after hitting double digit values rather than stopping every time they reached a new number.
Step 5: Repeat this activity several times throughout the week but increase the difficulty level by asking students to roll twice before moving back onto their original starting point or even skipping over certain numbers altogether depending on which strategy worked best last round.
This is just one idea for creating engaging mathematics exercises around everyday themes like sports! Feel free to modify or adapt it according to the needs of your classroom and individual learner strengths."

Title: Simple Addition Soccer Practice
Objective:
By completing this activity, students will practice adding two single digit numbers.
Materials needed: 
- Whiteboard or chalk board
- Marker or white charcoal pen
- A ball (can use any small object if balls are not available)
Instructions: 
1. Start by asking your class what their favorite part about playing soccer is.
2. Write down some responses on the board as examples such as ""scoring goals,"" ""running fast,"" etc.
3. Next, draw three lines across the top section of the board and label them ""Goalie"", ""Defender"" and ""Attacker."" Draw smaller sections underneath each title that say ""+5"",""+-4,"" ""-6"". These represent five minutes left before halftime when they need one more goal, minus four players from defense who got injured during gameplay, and six points deducted because there were too many fouls committed.
4. Ask the students to write out these problems using addition signs (+) instead of words (""one plus five""). For example, under Attacker it would read ""+5"" which means we have to score 9 additional goals within those remaining 5 minutes.
   - Make sure students understand the concept behind why + and – symbols can replace certain phrases in mathematical expressions.
    
5. After everyone has completed writing out all eight equations, ask them to turn around to face another student. Each pair must take turns saying aloud how much they added together. Use hand signals to indicate whether someone needs help figuring out an equation or wants to move onto another problem.
      - Remind students to count upwards after finding answers to avoid confusion with counting backwards.
        
6. Once every group has gone through the entire set twice, pass out paper clips to keep track of scores for the final round. Divide the room into teams of either three or four depending on preference and number availability. One player per team gets assigned the role of “referee”. When a referee calls time at half hour mark, whichever team scored last wins! If both teams tie for highest amount correct then whoever answered first wins.
       
This fun approach uses relativity familiar concepts of sports to teach basic arithmetic skills while engaging kids’ interest and creativity."
You are a passionate maths teacher for young children. Please create a simple math exercise with a football theme to teach children about additions of small integers. Think step by step.,"[INST] You are a passionate maths teacher for young children. Please create a simple math exercise with a football theme to teach children about additions of small integers. Think step by step. [/INST] Sure, let's start! Here is an addition problem using the concept ""how many balls do you have in your team?""

Step 1: Start by asking students how much they know their teams score and then ask them what ball number(s) that were scored. Let'll say one student has his favorite player wearing #9 jersey so he knows it was scored at least once from this goal (he doesn’t need more detail as we don‘t want him getting too complicated). So now we can set up our first equation: `X +Y = A` where X and Y stand respectively for goals made by other players besides himself or herself on his team, whereas A stands for total points earned by his team which includes both the known point obtained through the player whosejersey he likes most ,and others who may also contribute .
  
Step 2: Then proceed to introduce some new information such as 'the referee gave two yellow cards today.' Ask if anyone understands why these might be relevant? This will allow us to talk briefly around penalty kicks but not get bogged down into discussing penalties themselves just yet - instead focus on introducing the idea that there could potentially be additional points gained beyond simply scoring goals during gameplay itself, i.e., bonus points awarded after certain events occur within a match like free-kick awards due to misconducts etc. We continue building out our original question above adding something like : “If I had received three red cards, would my contribution change?” Now we can write another variable Z standing for any possible extra credit given based upon foul incidents happening in the course play, making our final answer look more complex than before; `A=B+C+D+E`, here B stands for actual scores while C refers specifically only to goals resulting directly from yellows shown (which isn’t part of regular scoring rules), D denotes potential bonuses because blue card infractions occurred and E represents whatever else happened apart from all those factors mentioned above.
   
Remember though, keep things very basic without going overly complicating concepts when teaching kids!"
